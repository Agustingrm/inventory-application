# Inventory Site

Following the guide proposed by www.theodinproject.com to study **Node.js**, I found a MDN tutorial to make functional applications that have the possibility to perform CRUD. Once finished the course proposed by them, I started to make my own application that performs the same functions, taking as inspiration an inventory application that can be accessed from anywhere. This page was made following the **MVC** guidelines. (Model-View-Controller)

## Language and Technologies Employed

- This application was made entirely in **Node.js** using the **Express** framework.
- **EJS** was used as the template language to create the pages.
- The styling was done with **SASS**.
